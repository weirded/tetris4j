###### Lazy eyed tetris4j

Experimental clone of tetris4j (released under GPL here: https://code.google.com/p/tetris4j).
Modified to be used with a pair of red/green glasses for experimental treatment of lazy eye/amblyopia.

The underlying research was done at McGill University, who conducted a study of 18 adults with lazy
eye using Tetris.

As far as I know, their version has not been made available to the general public. This tetris4j clone
is an attempt at replicating it.
